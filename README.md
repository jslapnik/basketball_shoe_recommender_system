# Basketball Shoe Recommender System

  For my General Assembly DSI capstone, I decided to bring one of my greatest passions, basketball shoes, into my course. The best way I thought of doing this was to build a recommender system. After doing some research, I found out that there currently is not a recommender system out there for basketball shoes. I found one for running shoes, but that was it. With basketball shoes, it can be tricky to find a pair that looks good and feels good. Once you find that pair, you more than likely want a similar shoe once it's time to move on to a new pair.
  
  Most recommenders are built using rating systems, like an average out of five or ten. I was initially going to do that, but it was illegal to scrape that site. I decided to change up and build a recommender based on written reviews. I turned to my favorite review site: weartesters.com. This site is well respected in the sneaker industry for its in-depth honest reviews of the latest basketball shoes. I was granted permission to scrape the site for all of the performance reviews. For my recommender system, I used NLP to drop the stop words and give weights to the important words.
