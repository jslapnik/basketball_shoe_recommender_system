# Basketball Shoe Recommender System

  For my General Assembly Data Science Immersive Program capstone, I decided to bring one of my greatest passions, basketball shoes, into my course. The best way I thought of doing this was to build a recommender system. After doing some research, I found out that there currently is not a recommender system out there for basketball shoes. With basketball shoes, it can be tricky to find a pair that looks good and feels good. Once you find that pair, you more than likely want a similar shoe once it is time to move on to a new pair. Like most people looking for an honest shoe review, I turned to weartesters.com. This site is well respected in the sneaker industry for its in-depth honest reviews of the latest basketball shoes. The best part of this site is how ubiased the reviewers are. They just want to revierw basketball shoes for the people. They don't care about the brand. If a shoe is good, it's good. I was granted permission to scrape the site for all of their performance reviews.
  
  Most recommenders are built using rating systems, like an average out of five or ten. Weartesters does fully written reviews instead of a rating system. To begin, I had to gain permission from WearTesters to scrape their site. Once that was achieved, I went on to scrape their review page to acquire each link to the individual reviews. I then went through again and scrpaed the data from every link. This scrape gave me the full review from each link, as well as every image and advertisement. I then had to go thorugh and remove everything besides the reviews.
