# Basketball Shoe Recommender System

For my General Assembly Data Science Immersive Program capstone, I decided to bring one of my greatest passions, basketball shoes, into my course. The best way I thought of doing this was to build a recommender system. After doing some research, I found out that there currently is not a recommender system out there for basketball shoes. With basketball shoes, it can be tricky to find a pair that looks good and feels good. Once you find that pair, you more than likely want a similar shoe once it is time to move on to a new pair. Like most people looking for an honest shoe review, I turned to weartesters.com. This site is well respected in the sneaker industry for its in-depth honest reviews of the latest basketball shoes. The best part of this site is how ubiased the reviewers are. They just want to review basketball shoes for the people. They don't care about the brand. If a shoe is good, it is good. If it is not, they let the viewers and readers know.
